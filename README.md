Lesson 2.2
Setting Up Scenes
Introduction to Storyboards by setting up three scenes.  In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn the fundamentals of storyboards and see how to add UI components to scenes.

* Resize scenes to iPhone 4.7" (iPhone 6)
* Tab Bar Controller doesn't need to be resized because it isn't visible to the user
* Name Scene 1 and 2 with meaningful names - Activity & Performance
* To create the third scene, we're going to create a copy of an existing scene 
* Open the Document Outline
* Drag the 2nd scene onto the storyboard, which creates a copy (scene 3)
* Add third scene
* scene 3 will be on top of scene 2.  Drag it over to see it.
* Change the main label on scene 3 to "Add Activity"
* Remove labels from scene 1
* Add a Picker View to scene 1 and adjust width to each margin of scene 1
* This Picker View will contain our listing of activities
* Add a label to scene 1 below the picker.  This is out countdown label.  Adjust the font size to 38
* Drag a button below the label.  Stretch width to each scene margin.
* Go to scene 2 (Performance Scene).  Remove the labels just like we did in scene 1.
* Drag a tableview onto scene 2 from the object library.  Adjust tableview width to scene width.  Adjust height so status bar at the top and tab bar at the bottom are visible
* In scene 3, remove these labels as well
* Drag a label onto scene 3 and adjust width to scene margins
* Drag a text field onto scene 3 below the label and adjust width to margins as well
* Drag a button below the text field and adjust width to margins
* Change the button text to "Save Activity"
* Select iPhone 6 from the run menu and run the app
* You can switch between the two tabs and see the UI elements we've added
* Notice scene 3 is not yet there.  We will wire it up in the next lesson
